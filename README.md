# 6502-Emulator
An emulator for the NMOS Systems 6502 8-bit microprocessor. This is a work in progress.

Though the present scope of this project is to be an emulator of the 6502 microprocessor, I intend to fork it to create an emulator for a RISC V processor that I am currently designing.

Any contributions will be appreciated.
